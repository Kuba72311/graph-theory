# Why Does this Repository Exist?

This repository was created as part of my final submission for the Graph Theory module in Software Development in GMIT.
It contains this readMe file and two notebooks containing material I had studied during this module. Below you can find a breakdown of the two notebooks.

# HeapSort Notebook

This notebook was written while I was studying the heapSort algorithm. It contains the following bits of information:

- An explanation of the heapSort algorithm and the steps followed by it.
- An implementation of the heapSort algorithm written in Python.
- Calculations of the Computational complexity of the heapSort algorithm.
- A list of references that I used while learning about heapSort and creating this notebook.

# Graph Isomorphism

This notebook was written while I was studying Graph Isomorphism and The Graph Isomophism problem. It contains the following:

- An explanation of the graph isomorphism problem and isomorphism.
- An explanation of graphs and how they can be represented in Data Structures.
- A list of references that I used while learning about Graph Isomorphism.

# What I Used / How I Developed my Notebooks

The two notebooks were created using jupyter. As jupyter is a python package, I had to install jupyter as well as a version of python.
In order to do this, I downloaded anaconda from (https://www.anaconda.com/) which is an installer that installs python and various python packages on your machine. I also needed to download a terminal as the default windows terminal was not sufficient for this project. I opted to use "cmder" and downloaded it from(https://cmder.net/). Once I had these programs installed, I used cmder to launch jupyter notebook. I did this by navigating to my repository folder for this project in cmder and typing "jupyter notebook" in the terminal in order to launch jupyter. This can be run on any machine with python and jupyter installed. Simply type "jupyter notebook" in the command terminal of your choice while being in the correct directory on your machine.
