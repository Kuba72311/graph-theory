# Why Does this Repository Exist?

This repository was created as part of my final submission for the Graph Theory module in Software Development in GMIT.
It contains this readMe file and two notebooks containing material I had studied during this module. Below you can find a breakdown of the two notebooks.

# HeapSort Notebook

This notebook was written while I was studying the heapSort algorithm. It contains the following bits of information:

- An explanation of the heapSort algorithm and the steps followed by it.
- An implementation of the heapSort algorithm written in Python.
- Calculations of the Computational complexity of the heapSort algorithm.
- A list of references that I used while learning about heapSort and creating this notebook.

# Graph Isomorphism

This notebook was written while I was studying Graph Isomorphism and The Graph Isomophism problem. It contains the following:

- An explanation of the graph isomorphism problem and isomorphism.
- An explanation of graphs and how they can be represented in Data Structures.
- A list of references that I used while learning about Graph Isomorphism.
