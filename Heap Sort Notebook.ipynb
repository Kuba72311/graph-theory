    "HeapSort is a sorting algorithm widely used in computer programming. It is popular and efficient and it requires knowledge of two data structures known as arrays and trees.\n",

    "1: Starts by removing the root value from the array and places it at the last position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: The last value is placed in the empty spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: The size of the heap is then decremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4: Heapify is run on the heap to ensure that the highest value is at the root of the list.\n",
